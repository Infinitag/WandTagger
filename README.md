# Infinitag Wand-Tagger

This project was implemented in the course of Halloween and represents an affordable and simple mini laser tagger in the form of a magic wand.

## Hardware

- Arduino Mini Pro

## Write Sketch with Windows

I use a USB2TTL converter to write the sketch to the Arduino Mini Pro.

### Problems with Windows 10

With Windows there were some challenges here.

With Windows 10 the following error message was displayed:

> PL2303HXA PHASED OUT SINCE 2012. PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPLIER.

I found the solution on the following website:

Additionally, I have included the file in the repo in case it is no longer available:
